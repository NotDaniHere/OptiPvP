# OptiPvP, a compact Minecraft Client.
OptiPvP Minecraft PvP Client for 1.8.
Works with Offline Accounts.
Client is currently in Alpha (Preview) state. The Beta state is being currently worked on (https://github.com/NotDaniHere/OptiPvP-DEV)




you may use the client however you may want, but if you are showing it off in a video or streaming using the client its recommended you turn the watermark on so more people would download the client, thanks a lot.
