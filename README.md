# What is OptiPvP?
OptiPvP is a Minecraft Client coded on in my free time

DISCLAIMER: The part where you get paid for playing will only be available on the full release, so expect it not to work for now.
you may use the client however you may want, but if you are showing it off in a video or streaming using the client its recommended you turn the watermark on so more people would download the client, thanks a lot.
