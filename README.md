# What is OptiPvP?
OptiPvP is a 1.8 Minecraft Client, which pays you for playing Minecraft (In crypto). You can either Withdraw the OptiPvP Tokens you earn, or spend them on the shop for cosmetics. Official Website for OptiPvP is https://website.optipvp.xyz. Please consider using this Client. 
Client is currently in Alpha (Preview) state. The Beta state is being currently worked on (https://github.com/NotDaniHere/OptiPvP-DEV)



DISCLAIMER: The part where you get paid for playing will only be available on the full release, so expect it not to work for now.
you may use the client however you may want, but if you are showing it off in a video or streaming using the client its recommended you turn the watermark on so more people would download the client, thanks a lot.
